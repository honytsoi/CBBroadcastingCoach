# Backend readme

The backend is a cloudflare worker using the cloudflare AI.

All the prompts and logic are in the backend.

The backend is not a generic AI, it only is useful in response to the structured messages front the frontend that contain key information such as the chatoom status, recent events, and broadcaster information and special instructions.

The backend responds with something to do or say to help the broadcaster have a more successful stream.

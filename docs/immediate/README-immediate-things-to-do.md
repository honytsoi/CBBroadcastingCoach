# Immediate Tasks Overview

For every task, where possible, create a test framework that independantly tests the functions created or edited. See the tests/user-manager.test.js as an example.  Do NOT MOCK FAILED TESTS. If something can't be tested, then note it and move on. Getting functional tests that actually test what is testable, but ignore things that are not testable in this test environment, is more important than getting "passes". I don't want to see fake passes that don't really mean anything.
